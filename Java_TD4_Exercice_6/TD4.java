/* Exercice 1

a) false
b) depends, if the child is abstract, must define all the abstract method
c) not necessary
d) false, panent can be concrete
e) true
f) false
g) false, but it will be a problem with protected and abstract because we would'nt be able to access it
h) true
i) false, but with the abstract constructors can only be used in the child class, not the main | super() from the child needs abstract class constructors
j) false, because we are in the same class, but we have to implement the method before trying using the method inside the class that define them
k) false
l) false
m) true
n) false

Exercice 2

1) an instance of the Car class can launch the stop method

Exercice 3

1) nothing wrong
2) nothing wrong
3) error, defining class B as abstract or implementing the second method
4) nothing wrong, this is the correction of 3)
5) error, missing abstract
6) error
7) method b not yet implemented, error, can't be used
8) not implemented, need to define the method as abstract, or we implement it if it is not abstract
9) not allowed to define abstract method in concrete class
10) wrong, need to declare abstract in class

Exercice 4

1) output : 
a = 0
a = 20

x = 0
x = 0

Exercice 5

Because we have value which is static and final, we can call a method using the interface as parameter
In the main, we are creating a class and call a method over the interface
